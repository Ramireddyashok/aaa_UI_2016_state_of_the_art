### What Is This App?

 * This app was created in response to [this blog challenge](https://betterologist.net/2016/07/you-are-a-failure-full-stack-2016-if/) to become a true 2016 full stack developer.
 * It is made in response to the need for a HelloWorld app with the two features outlined below.
 
### Features

 * Written in Polymer
 * Uses Material Design
 
 This knocks out the first two objectives of the above mentioned Full Stack challenge.
 
 It would be out of scope for this project to go into the long winded reasons why Polymer and Material Design 
 are excellent choices for building many/most modern UI, but it is my personal opinion that this is the case.
 
 Polymer lacks the heft of a more comprensive framework, such as Angular. But that's the big win, 
 if you study such things from the  direction that I lean towards. 
 React is also a good choice for this same reason, but I lean to Polymer.
 
### HelloWorld Google-signin

To run this app as a HelloWorld, you'll need to do some setup first. What follows may be the easiest way:

 * Install [Polymer CLI using these instructions](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/toolbox/set-up#install-the-polymer-cli)
 * run **polymer serve** to see it running on your box
 
You can now inspect the code, and get to a spot where you implement your own quick HelloWorld. Pretty dumb stuff.
 
### Is there an online demo running?

Yes. [ttfhw1.datafundamentals.com](https://ttfhw1.datafundamentals.com)

### How This App Was Created

This base app was created by [Polymer CLI using these instructions](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/toolbox/set-up#install-the-polymer-cli).

It's pretty lame stuff as this kind of work goes. But it makes for a nice foundation.

### Have You Written Anything More than HelloWorld in Polymer?

Yes! Thanks for asking!
